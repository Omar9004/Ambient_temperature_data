# Ambient Temperature
This repository contains data from the internal thermal sensors of a mobile phone. These sensors are typically distributed around the mobileâ€™s internal components to measure their temperatures.
This data was collected primarily for my master's thesis at Halmstad University, which aimed to estimate the ambient temperature around a mobile phone using only its internal thermal sensors.
Additionally, machine learning and deep learning models can utilize this data to estimate the ambient temperature.
