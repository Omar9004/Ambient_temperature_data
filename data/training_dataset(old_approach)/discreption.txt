All the datasets in this folder were constructed using the old approach of collecting the ambient temperature inside the chamber. 
The ambient temperature measurement was conducted using an external multiplexer device with small sensors connected to the inner chamber of the oven.
Additionally, the datasets contain only some features that are used to train the latest version of Machine/Deep learning models. These features include charging_state,
screen_state, cpu_usage and others, which were not part of these datasets.

A brief explanation of each dataset existing in this folder:
camera_50to20c_23_2.csv: This dataset contains an experiment of mobile thermal state when the mobile recording video at 50C and 20C ambient temperature. The video quality ranges from 1080p up to 4k resolution.

cpu_loads_mix_amb_utf8.csv: This dataset contains an experiment of mobile thermal state under different cpu_workloads from 10C-50C ambient temperature. At each ambient temperature level, three experiments on the cpu_workload ratio were conducted on the mobile, including  100%, 75%, and 50%. However, keep in mind that the thermal management software system was activated, which throttles the CPU once the temperature of the CPU goes above a certain threshold.As a result, the CPU temperature didn't go up extremly high as we did in other experiments.

exper_cpu_disp_chg.csv: This dataset contains an experiment of mobile thermal state under different CPU_workloads at 23C ambient temperature. The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the screen state (on/off) and charging state(plugg/unplugg) on the mobile internal thermal state during the cpu_workloads. The two experiments in the middle showcase the thermal state under CPU_workload experiment together with the screen is on, and the charging state is off and on, respectively. The thermal management system software was activated.

extansive_dataset.csv: This dataset contains an experiment of mobile thermal state under different cpu_workloads from 0C-50C ambient temperature. At each ambient temperature level, three experiments on the cpu_workload ratio were conducted on the mobile, including 50%, 100%, and 75% . Each workloads ratio were repeated three times, because the aim was to ensure that the mobile phone behaviours the same  under a specific CPU_workloads ratio. The thermal management system software was activated.

idle_10_35_50.csv: This dataset contains only thermal data when the mobile is idle at 10C, 35C and 50C.

mix_CPU_loads_withBreak.csv: This dataset contains an experiment of mobile thermal state under different cpu_workloads from 0C-50C ambient temperature. At each ambient temperature level, three experiments on the cpu_workload ratio were conducted on the mobile, including  100%, 75%, and 50%. However, keep in mind that the thermal management software system was activated, which throttles the CPU once the temperature of the CPU goes above a certain threshold.As a result, the CPU temperature didn't go up extremly high as we did in other experiments. The full details of this experiment is in mix_CPU_loads_withBreak.png image.

verification.csv: This dataset was used as a test dataset to evaluate the performance of the old versions of ML/DP models.
